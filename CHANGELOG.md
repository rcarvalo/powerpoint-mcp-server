# Changelog - PowerPoint MCP Server

## [2.3.0] - 2024-10-19

### üîß Fixed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Replaced ChukMCP with pure FastMCP to resolve "Invalid tool schema" errors
- Fixed `add_bullet_points` and all other tools that were failing with schema validation
- Removed incompatible ChukMCP/FastMCP hybrid architecture

### ‚ú® Changed
- Migrated from ChukMCPServer to pure FastMCP implementation
- Simplified server architecture - now uses FastMCP directly
- Updated all `@tool` decorators to `@app.tool()` for FastMCP compatibility
- Streamlined command-line arguments (removed unused HTTP options)

### üìù Technical Details
**Problem**: ChukMCP and FastMCP use different tool registration systems. The previous version tried to bridge them with a `MockServer` class, which caused JSON Schema generation failures.

**Solution**: Removed all ChukMCP dependencies and use FastMCP natively. All 32 tools now register directly with FastMCP's `@app.tool()` decorator.

**Impact**: All tools now have valid JSON schemas that Claude can understand and use.
